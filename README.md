# Type Theory Seminar

## Resources

### Book: Type Theory and Formal Proof
Tentatively we are using this book: [https://www.amazon.com/Type-Theory-Formal-Proof-Introduction/dp/110703650X](https://www.amazon.com/Type-Theory-Formal-Proof-Introduction/dp/110703650X). If anyone has issues due to the price of the book, please let us know ASAP.

### Notes

TODO: make notes for chapter 1 and 2.

## **TENTATIVE** Schedule

Roughly we will plan to discuss primary content (i.e. readings from the book) on Tuesdays, and on Thurdays we can meet to discuss auxillary content such as alternate approaches to the material, more advanced material, etc. Later in the summer we plan to start a coding project, likely making a proof assistant.
